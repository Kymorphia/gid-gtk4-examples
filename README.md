= giD Gtk4 Examples

Here you will find an example application written using the D language and utilizing the [giD](https://github.com/Kymorphia/gid/) Gtk4 bindings.

Most of the examples were ported from these [Python PyGObject GTK4 Examples](https://pygobject.gnome.org/tutorials/gtk4.html).
Please consult that documentation for details on Gtk4 widgets which are relevant to each example.
The PyGObject Gtk4 API is fairly similar to the giD D binding and the example D code is intended to be used directly as a quickstart guide.
Each example has its own D source file and they are launched from within the example application by double clicking on them in the tree.
